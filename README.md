This contains the datasets and solutions for all the EDA and Machine Learning projects I have done on the Datacamp platform. 

These projects had problems belonging to different domains which helped in developing a broadened approach while handling any kind of data science task.

Through the EDA projects, I learned how visualizations can reveal a lot of information about the data that one fails to notice while working on the tabular form. 
I learned how to wield the fundamentals of statistics to derive obscure insights from data that can often make a sufficient solution in itself.

Through the ML projects, I learned how to build complete machine learning pipelines starting from data cleaning, feature transformation, EDA, 
feature engineering, feature selection, validation, model training, parameter tuning and evaluation.

These projects didn't just solidfy my data science concepts but also taught me to write clean, succinct and reproducible code.
